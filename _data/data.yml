career-profile:
    title: Welcome to Yongshin's page
    summary: |
      I graduated M.S. in the Graduate School of Data Science at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/"><u>KAIST</u></a>. I was a member of the <a href="https://ic.kaist.ac.kr/"><u>Interactive Computing Lab</u></a> advised by 
      <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=Sc2pBzYAAAAJ"><u>Prof. Uichin Lee</u></a>. I completed my master research for predicting human emotion using audio and physiological signals. In particular, I analyzed how the counterpart's 
      data positively affects the speaker's emotion prediction during the naturalistic conversation.
      <p>I am currently working as a machine learning researcher in <a href="http://www.okestro.com/"><u>Okestro</u></a>  studying text, voice related AI technologies such as Natural Language Processing(NLP), voice synthesis, and voice recognition.
      Our team is interested in research on automation of corporate analysis in the area of business intelligence using NLP.
      We are conducting research to provide a service that evaluates companies in real time in a cloud environment.</p>
      <p>Other than academic things, I enjoy exercising. I like sports using rackets such as badminton and tennis.
      Another hobby is playing Go. The rules are simple, but Go requires very deep strategic thinking, which provides a rest for my busy life.
      I'm a consistent person. I do my best to carry out any task with responsibility.</p>
      
#      In addition, I am interested in video and speech synthesis. I am also managing music generation research using GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks).
#      Unlike this, I previously studied causal analysis. Analyze time-series sensor data using causal techniques such as matching and CCM(Convergent Cross Mapping).

            This study presented SWOT Sentence BERT as an AIaaS model that can intellectually automate company SWOT analysis. 
            The SWOT Sentence BERT is a sentence embedding model that is learned through SWOT text data processed in the form of natural language inference task. In order to automate SWOT analysis, we applied K-Means clustering algorithm to make clusters with sentence embeddings and classified sentence embeddings based on their predicted clusters.

            We used emotion-related data called K-EmoCon collected during the debate process to empirically evaluate our model. The results showed that the counterpart’s speech and the physiological signals had a positive impact on predicting the speaker’s emotions.
