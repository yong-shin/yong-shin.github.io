career-profile:
    title: Welcome to Yongshin's page
    summary: |
      I completed an M.S. at the Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST, where I had the privilege of working in the <a href="https://ic.kaist.ac.kr/"><u>Interactive Computing Lab</u></a> under the mentorship of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=Sc2pBzYAAAAJ"><u>Prof. Uichin Lee</u></a>. 
      My master's research centered on predicting human emotions through audio and physiological signals, with a particular focus on how data from conversation partners can enhance the accuracy of emotion predictions for speakers during naturalistic interactions.      
      <p>Previously, I worked as a machine learning engineer at <a href="http://www.okestro.com/"><u>Okestro</u></a>, where I specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our team was dedicated to automating corporate 
      analysis in the field of business intelligence using NLP. We developed a service for real-time company evaluation in a cloud environment. We also explored generative models, 
      including the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to create a domain-specific chatbot. In addition, we worked on a project to finetuned an open-source gpt model such as Llama, 
      Orion to improve the RAG inference ability for GPT.</p>
      <p>I am currently a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home.html"><u>KPMG</u></a>, where I spearhead the development of a comprehensive AI platform that integrates cutting-edge 
      technologies—including chatbots, advanced data visualization, and specialized data analysis for sectors like manufacturing. My work spans the creation of 
      intuitive chatbot systems capable of handling diverse queries with context-aware precision, as well as visualization tools that interpret conversational 
      inputs to generate relevant charts.</p>
      <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through sports, particularly racket games like badminton and tennis. I also find relaxation in 
      playing Go, a game that, despite its simple rules, requires deep strategic thinking. I am known for my consistency and commitment, always striving to approach tasks with 
      responsibility and dedication.</p>
      
#      In addition, I am interested in video and speech synthesis. I am also managing music generation research using GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks).
#      Unlike this, I previously studied causal analysis. Analyze time-series sensor data using causal techniques such as matching and CCM(Convergent Cross Mapping).

      - title: KPMG | AI-Driven Ad Compliance Analyzer
        tagline: | 
            Before sending advertisements to advertisers, companies must undergo preliminary review based on internal advertising regulations. 
            This preliminary advertising review is not about expertise, but rather a task of meticulously examining content according to internal guidelines. 
            In other words, it's a simple repetitive task. We developed a service that automates this process using Large Language Models (LLMs). 
            The system processes advertising data through image conversion, text extraction, and analysis via LLM to evaluate compliance with regulations. 
            Through this service, company advertising managers can now know the compliance rate of advertisements without needing to conduct preliminary reviews themselves.

            We developed a solution that tackles the overwhelming daily document uploads on the U.S. trade administration (https://access.trade.gov/), 
            eliminating the need for customs experts to manually search through vast amounts of data. By implementing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
            system, we've created an automated workflow that crawls, collects, and vectorizes documents in a Milvus database, allowing for efficient cosine 
            similarity searches. Customers can now instantly discover relevant cases and make inquiries about them through our intuitive chatbot interface. 
            Our query-rewriting technology extracts filtering elements such as year and case codes from customer queries, enabling targeted vector searches 
            and significantly enhancing performance for customs experts.

            extensive database of over 300 security-related resources and AI-powered web searches, we comprehensively review policies to identify missing elements and
            ensure alignment with the latest security trends. The system delivers rapid, precise assessments while maintaining uniform quality standards regardless of
            the complexity of the security framework. Additionally, we provide an intuitive chatbot service that allows users to ask questions based on the analysis 
            results, making security policy management more efficient and effective.

      - title: Okestro | Korean Embedding Model Pipeline in Closed Network RAG System
        tagline: | 
            In order to provide chatbot services to customers in a closed network environment, it is essential to provide an embedding model. 
            We are working on a project to secure a high-performance Korean language embedding model. As a project leader, I researched several baseline Korean embedding models on the huggingface.
            We selected a baseline model and automated the construction of a dataset for embedding model fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the embedding model using these datasets, 
            we were able to have a Korean embedding model with significantly better performance than the text-ada-embedding-002 provided by OpenAI.

      - title: Okestro | FAQ Classification
        tagline: | 
            This paper contributes to enhancing the experience of users and administrators in the FAQ system.
            We present a model that uses BERT and contrastive learning to automatically classify users' inquiries. 
            The model eliminates the need for users to have domain knowledge or for administrators to classify multiple inquiries. 
            This can significantly improve the efficiency of the inquiry management system, reduce the workload of users and administrators and enhance the overall user experience.

            In this study, we propose a method for predicting the emotions of the speaker in the naturalistic conversation using a speaker encoder and counterpart encoder composed of CNN-LSTM deep learning networks. 
            We used emotion-related data called K-EmoCon collected during the debate process to empirically evaluate our model. The results showed that the counterpart’s speech and the physiological signals had a positive impact on predicting the speaker’s emotions.
